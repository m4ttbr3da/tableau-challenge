### Tableau Challenge - Citi Bike Analytics

## Background

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

While the data has been regularly updated, there is currently no dashboard or sophisticated reporting process available to help users or interested observers identify trends. For this project, I built a set of data reports to provide answers to some basic questions for the period between 2018 - 2020.

### Key Observations:

* CityBike usage is highly seasonal, with both average trip duration and the overall number of trips indexing significantly higher from between May and September. 

* This seasonal trend has been roughly consistent across years, reflecting the more favorable weather for bike riding during these months, but 2020 did feature several notable discrepancies from years past.

* Overall usage fell sharply in March and April of 2020 and remained generally lower on a year-over-year basis throughout the balance of the year, likely reflecting the impact of stay-at-home orders and lower overall demand to share CityBikes in lieu of potential transmission fears. While overall usage was down notably, monthly seasonality in 2020 remained largely consistent with 2018 - 2019, albeit with a slightly greater concentration of usage in the Fall months.

* Average trip duration in 2020 was generally much higher than in prior years, which may reflect a greater concentration of usage among "hardcore" CityBike users, or users who may rely principally on CityBikes for transportation. In other words, the threat of coronavirus may have limited demand among more casual users, demonstrated through longer rides and a lower number of overall trips.

* CityBike users tend to be younger and and generally skew more male than female.

* The average age of CityBike users has stayed generally consistent between 2018 - 2020, although there has been a modest shift upwards, likely highlighting increased adoption among middle-aged and older users as the service has become more prevalent.

* The gender mix of users has been generally consistent for riders who identify as females. The mix of female users has held steady at roughly 20 - 25% of all annual users between 2018 - 2020, but there was a significant increase in the percentage of users who did not identify as either male or female in 2020.

* A significantly higher number of users in 2020 were not CityBike subscribers. This could reflect a greater concentration of riders who were new to the service, and were potentially induced to try CityBikes for the first time as a way to exercise or spend time outside in lieu of widespread stay-at-home orders.
